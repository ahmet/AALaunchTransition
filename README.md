# AALaunchTransition

[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

Simple framework to let your application's launch image fade-out to its initial view. Feel free to fork this repo and help me make it better.

If you're using this framework in your project, I'd like to know! [Send me an email](mailto:me@ahmetaygun.net).

## Adding to your project

1. Clone this repo and build the project.
* Obtain `AALaunchTransition.framework` from Products folder.
* Open your project and add `AALaunchTransition.framework` in **Link binary with libraries** section of **Build Phases** under its proper target.

### CocoaPods

If you are using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) add following line to your Podfile and then run `pod install`

``` ruby
pod 'AALaunchTransition'
```

## Usage

After adding framework to your project all you need is import LaunchView.h in your initial view controller, then initialize a LaunchView instance and add it to your initial view as subview.

```objective-c
#import <AALaunchTransition/LaunchView.h>
...
- (void)viewDidLoad
{
    [super viewDidLoad];

    LaunchView *launch = [[LaunchView alloc] init];
    [self.view addSubview:launch];

    //Other additions

    [self.view bringSubviewToFront:launch];
}
```

Easy as that. (See [LaunchView.h](https://github.com/ahmet/AALaunchTransition/blob/develop/AALaunchTransition/LaunchView.h) for all of the methods.)
